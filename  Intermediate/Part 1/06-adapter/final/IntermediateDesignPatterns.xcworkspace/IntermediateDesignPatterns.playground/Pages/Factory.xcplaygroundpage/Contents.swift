 The factory pattern provides a way to create objects without exposing creation logic. It involves two types:
 
 1. The **factory** creates objects.
 2. The **products** are the objects that are created.
 
 ## Code Example

import Foundation

public struct JobApplicant {
  public enum Status {
    case new
    case interview
    case hired
    case rejected
  }
  public let name: String
  public let email: String
  public var status: Status
}

public struct Email {
  public let subject: String
  public let messageBody: String
  public let recipientEmail: String
  public let senderEmail: String
}

public struct EmailFactory {
  public let senderEmail: String
  
  public func createEmail(to recipient: JobApplicant) -> Email {
    let subject: String
    let messageBody: String
    switch recipient.status {
    case .new:
      subject = "We Received Your Application"
      messageBody = "Thanks for applying for a job here! " +
        "You should hear from us in 17-42 business days."
      
    case .interview:
      subject = "We Want to Interview You"
      messageBody = "Thanks for your resume, \(recipient.name)! " +
        "Can you come in for an interview in 30 minutes?"
      
    case .hired:
      subject = "We Want to Hire You"
      messageBody = "Congratulations, \(recipient.name)! " +
        "We liked your code, and you smelled nice. " +
        "We want to offer you a position! Cha-ching! $$$"
      
    case .rejected:
      subject = "Thanks for Your Application"
      messageBody = "Thank you for applying, \(recipient.name)! " +
        "We have decided to move forward with other candidates. " +
        "Please remember to wear pants next time!"
    }
    return Email(subject: subject,
                 messageBody: messageBody,
                 recipientEmail: recipient.email,
                 senderEmail: senderEmail)

// Example
var jackson = JobApplicant(name: "Jackson Smith",
                           email: "jackson.smith@example.com",
                           status: .new)
